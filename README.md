# Intel SGX "Hello World"

This is meant to be a base template for an [Intel SGX](https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx/) application on Linux. Not sure if it is just me, but I feel the documentations on Intel SGX development on Linux is still sorely lacking. This meant to be a stub of a "Getting-started" tutorial.

This template is based on the SampleEnclave app of the sample enclaves provided with the Intel SGX Linux [drivers](https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx-driver) and [SDK](https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx/).

## Features

- Sample code for doing `ECALL`
- Sample code for doing `OCALL`
- Sample code for sealing

## TODO

- Tutorial explaining what each directory and file is used for.

- Write a getting started tutorial.

## Contribute

Any help to cut down the number of codes and adding explanations (especially the Makefile) will be much appreciated!
